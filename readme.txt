Distributed Tracking:
Every 10 Minutes the names on your KoS-List are published to your Guild and current Zone - if a other player in the
guild/zone uses VanasKoS, he receives that list and looks for your KoS-targets too.
If the other player finds one of your KoS-targets, he sends you automagically a message with his current position,
so you can get your revenge.
If you have Cartographer installed, you'll be additionally asked if you want to create a Mapnote at the received location.
