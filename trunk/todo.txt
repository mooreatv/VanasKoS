Bugfixes:
- fix friendsframe when mainframe is showing and vice versa - doesn't work even if everything should.. i blame it on blizzard
- heal spells in raid appear to be always in hostile channels

New Features:
defaultlists:
+ right-click contextmenu to move entries between lists
+ add a last attacker list with possibility to add from there
/ last seen list (like opium)

tooltip:
+ add pvp stats

notifier:
- more structured configuration options, esp. when pvp stats are displayed and more can be displayed, it's needed

sync:
+ allow guild sync - option to accept guild broadcasts depending on rank of broadcasting member and option to
  broadcast lists to guild channel every 30min,1h,2h

distributed tracking:
+ allow selection of which channels to listen on (guild/zone)
+ join zone/guild comm channel after 1minute (to prevent being comm channel on /1 on some computers) (done in 2.87)

pvp:
- always gather all player data (optional, default off)
+ pvp log, record each pvp win/loss with zone, posX, posY, time, yourlevel, enemylevel - maybe showing these 
  with cartographer (except cartographer done)
- optional chooser on death/win

Other:
- documentation for all the functions (esp. auto sync, distributed tracking)
- maybe a mob watchlist for detecting searched mobs
